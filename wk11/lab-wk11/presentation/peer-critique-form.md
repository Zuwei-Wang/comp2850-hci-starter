## Instructions

As a peer reviewer, provide **constructive, actionable feedback** using this structured form. Focus on:
- Evidence quality (is every claim backed by data?)
- Accessibility proof (did they actually demonstrate compliance?)
- Limitations acknowledgment (were trade-offs discussed honestly?)
- Clarity of presentation (could you follow the narrative?)

Use the **3-2-1 framework**:
- 3 Strengths (what worked well)
- 2 Improvements (what needs work)
- 1 Question (something unclear or missing)

- [ ] **Data source documented** (CSV files, pilot notes, screenshots)
- [ ] **Sample size acknowledged** (n=5? more? less?)
- [ ] **Every claim traceable** (can you find the data backing each statement?)

## Section 2: Accessibility Proof

**Rating**: ☐ Excellent  ☐ Good  ☐ Fair  ☐ Poor

### Checklist

- [ ] **Live demo shown** (not just described)
- [ ] **Screen reader tested** (NVDA/JAWS/Narrator)
- [ ] **Keyboard-only tested** (no mouse, all functions accessible)
- [ ] **No-JS tested** (JavaScript disabled, still works)
- [ ] **WCAG criteria explicitly referenced** (2.1.1, 3.3.1, 4.1.3 etc.)
- [ ] **Before/after contrast shown** (could see the improvement)

### Demo observations

**Did demos work?**  
☐ Yes, all succeeded  ☐ Partial (some failed)  ☐ No (all failed or not attempted)

**If demos failed, did presenter:**  
☐ Show backup video  ☐ Explain what should have happened  ☐ Skipped/ignored

**Most convincing demo**: ___________________________________________

**Least convincing demo**: ___________________________________________

## Section 3: Implementation Quality

**Rating**: ☐ Excellent  ☐ Good  ☐ Fair  ☐ Poor

### Checklist

- [ ] **Solution described clearly** (cookies? ARIA? focus management?)
- [ ] **Code shown** (snippets visible in slides or IDE)
- [ ] **Trade-offs acknowledged** (simplicity vs robustness? performance vs parity?)
- [ ] **Alternative approaches considered** (did they explain why they chose this approach?)
- [ ] **Scalability discussed** (would this work for 1000 tasks? 100 users?)

### Technical observations

**Solution approach**: ☐ Elegant  ☐ Adequate  ☐ Over-complicated  ☐ Unclear

**Code quality** (if shown): ☐ Clean  ☐ Readable  ☐ Messy  ☐ Not shown

**Trade-offs clearly explained?**: ☐ Yes  ☐ Partially  ☐ No

## Section 4: Limitations & Honesty

**Rating**: ☐ Excellent  ☐ Good  ☐ Fair  ☐ Poor

### Checklist

- [ ] **Sample size acknowledged** (n=5 is formative, not generalizable)
- [ ] **Edge cases mentioned** (what might break? what wasn't tested?)
- [ ] **Threats to validity** (mock data? biased sample? time constraints?)
- [ ] **Future work outlined** (what would they do with more time/resources?)
- [ ] **Honest about failures** (did they hide problems or own them?)

### Observations

**Did presenter oversell results?**  
☐ No, appropriately cautious  ☐ Slightly oversold  ☐ Yes, made unsupported claims

**Most honest acknowledgment**: ___________________________________________

**Limitation they should have mentioned but didn't**: ___________________________________________

## Section 5: Presentation Quality

**Rating**: ☐ Excellent  ☐ Good  ☐ Fair  ☐ Poor

### Checklist

- [ ] **Clear narrative** (problem → data → solution → proof)
- [ ] **Good pacing** (not too rushed or too slow)
- [ ] **Visual aids effective** (slides/tables/charts readable)
- [ ] **Audience engagement** (eye contact, clear speech)
- [ ] **Time management** (15 min, good balance across sections)

### Timing breakdown (approximate)

- Problem statement: ____ min
- Metrics: ____ min
- Demos: ____ min
- Q&A: ____ min
- **Total**: ____ min

**Pacing**: ☐ Too fast  ☐ Just right  ☐ Too slow

**Most engaging section**: ___________________________________________

**Least engaging section**: ___________________________________________

## Section 10: Sharing Feedback

**Recommended approach**:

1. **Start with praise**: "Your evidence chain was really clear, especially the CSV → analysis → prioritization flow."

2. **Offer improvements gently**: "One thing that would strengthen this: show the cookie value in DevTools during the no-JS demo. That makes the state transfer visible."

3. **Ask curious questions**: "I noticed the error div has both role='alert' and aria-live='assertive'. Is that redundant, or does it improve compatibility?"

4. **End constructively**: "Overall, this is solid work. With real pilot data, this would be publication-ready."

**What NOT to do**:
- ❌ Don't say "This is wrong" → Say "Have you considered..."
- ❌ Don't focus only on negatives → Balance with positives
- ❌ Don't ask questions you already know the answer to (don't quiz them)
- ❌ Don't dominate Q&A → Share speaking time with other critics
